# Experimental Game Engine

This folder contains experimental code for a new game engine implementation. It is completely isolated from the main Kaspa Brawl application and can be safely deleted without affecting the main codebase.

## Structure

- `src/` - Source code for the experimental engine
- `assets/` - Test assets for the experimental engine
- `docs/` - Documentation and design notes

## Getting Started

This is an isolated experiment that can be run separately from the main application.

```
cd /workspaces/kaspabrawl/experiments/new-engine
npm install
npm run dev
```
