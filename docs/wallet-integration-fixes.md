# KaspaWallet Integration Fixes

We have implemented several improvements to fix the KaspaWallet integration issues that were preventing users from logging in to Kaspa Brawl:

## Core Fixes

1. **Enhanced Signature Verification**
   - Updated the `verifySignature` function in `/lib/auth.ts` to better handle different wallet signature formats
   - Added development mode bypass for easier testing
   - Fixed compilation errors related to the kaspacore library

2. **Improved Wallet Detection and Compatibility**
   - Created a new utility `/utils/kaspaWalletHelper.ts` that handles different wallet versions (KaspaWallet and Kasware)
   - Added compatibility checks to detect and report potential wallet version issues
   - Implemented functions to handle wallet connection and signing with proper error handling

3. **Enhanced Authentication Flow**
   - Updated the `KaspaWalletAuth.tsx` component to use our new wallet helper utilities
   - Added better error handling and logging throughout the authentication process
   - Implemented a complete auth flow including token generation and storage

## Diagnostic Tools

1. **Wallet Test Pages**
   - Created a basic wallet test page at `/pages/wallet-test.tsx`
   - Added an enhanced wallet test page at `/pages/enhanced-wallet-test.tsx` with detailed diagnostics
   - Added a debug mode toggle in the enhanced test page to help troubleshoot issues

2. **API Endpoints**
   - Added a debug endpoint at `/api/debug/wallet-info.ts` to help diagnose connection issues
   - Enhanced the nonce generation endpoint with better error handling and debugging
   - Improved error formatting in API responses

## UI Improvements

1. **Better User Experience**
   - Added a wallet help section to the main page with troubleshooting tips
   - Implemented clearer error messages during the connection process
   - Created documentation explaining the wallet connection process

2. **Documentation**
   - Added a comprehensive guide at `/docs/walletIntegration.md` explaining how to use and troubleshoot wallet connections

## Developer Improvements

1. **Flexible Development Environment**
   - Added development mode fallbacks to make testing easier
   - Implemented better error logging throughout the authentication flow
   - Created helper functions to assist with wallet compatibility detection

## Testing

To test the fixes:

1. Start the development server using `npm run dev`
2. Visit the home page and attempt to connect with either KaspaWallet or Kasware
3. If experiencing issues, use the wallet test pages at `/wallet-test` or `/enhanced-wallet-test`
4. Check browser console for detailed error messages

These changes should resolve the authentication issues users were experiencing with KaspaWallet integration in the Kaspa Brawl game.
