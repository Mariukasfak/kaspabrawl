# KaspaWallet Integration Fixes

This document outlines the changes made to fix the KaspaWallet integration issues in Kaspa Brawl.

## Overview of Issues

1. **React Hydration Errors**
   - Server: 'KasWare Not Found' vs Client: 'Connect Wallet'
   - Inconsistent rendering between server and client causing React hydration mismatch

2. **Missing Signature Errors**
   - Problems with wallet signature handling
   - Missing or invalid signatures during verification

3. **Wallet Connection Flow**
   - Unreliable wallet detection and connection
   - Error handling and user feedback issues

## Implemented Fixes

### 1. React Hydration Fixes

Modified Header components to use consistent text between server and client rendering:

```tsx
{/* Use a consistent initial state to avoid hydration issues */}
{isConnecting ? (
  <span className="flex items-center">
    <Spinner size="sm" className="mr-2" />
    Connecting...
  </span>
) : (
  <span>Connect Wallet</span>
)}
```

Instead of conditional rendering based on wallet availability which can differ between server and client.

### 2. Enhanced Signature Handling

- Improved `signWithWallet` function in `kaspaWalletHelper.ts`
- Added detailed validation for wallet signature data
- Enhanced error handling for empty or invalid signatures
- Added extensive logging for debugging purposes

### 3. Flexible Verification Endpoint

- Updated `/pages/api/auth/verify.ts` to handle various signature formats
- Added more robust extraction of signature data from different wallet formats
- Enhanced validation and error handling

### 4. Development Mode Improvements

- Added development mode bypass for verification to facilitate testing
- Added detailed logging for debugging signature issues

### 5. Debug Tools

- Created enhanced debug endpoint (`/api/debug/kasware-signature-debug-v2.ts`)
- Added wallet connection diagnostics page for testing
- Improved error reporting and logging

## Testing the Fixes

To test the wallet connection:

1. Navigate to `/wallet-connection-diagnostics` for comprehensive testing
2. The page provides detailed diagnostics and logs of the connection process
3. Test wallet detection, connection, and signature verification independently

## Common Issues and Troubleshooting

1. **Wallet Not Detected**
   - Ensure you have KaspaWallet or Kasware extension installed
   - Try refreshing the page
   - Check browser console for errors

2. **Signature Verification Fails**
   - Check the debug logs for specific signature errors
   - Use the diagnostics page to test direct signature functionality
   - In development mode, verification will be bypassed

3. **Hydration Errors**
   - Clear browser cache and reload
   - The fixes ensure consistent rendering between server and client

## Next Steps

1. Implement proper cryptographic signature verification in production mode
2. Add support for additional wallet types
3. Enhance error recovery and reconnection logic
