# Character Progression System Implementation

## Important Implementation Guidelines

1. **Integration First Approach**
   - ⚠️ Always integrate new features into the existing game systems
   - ⚠️ Do not create separate demos or standalone systems
   - ⚠️ Reuse existing assets and systems whenever possible
   - ⚠️ Focus on enhancing what's already built, not creating parallel implementations

2. **Asset Management**
   - ⚠️ Use existing game sprites and assets
   - ⚠️ Only create new visual effects for specific actions (hit splashes, level-up effects)
   - ⚠️ Maintain visual consistency with the established game aesthetic

## Completed Tasks

1. **Core Progression System**
   - ✓ Created `ICharacter` interface and `BaseCharacter` abstract class
   - ✓ Implemented specific classes for Mage, Fighter, and Ranger
   - ✓ Added XP, leveling, and stat allocation functionality
   - ✓ Added HP scaling based on class (Fighter highest, Ranger medium, Mage lowest)
   - ✓ Added class-specific main stat increases (+1 per level)

2. **Special Abilities System**
   - ✓ Created `SpecialAbility` interface and `AbilityType` enum
   - ✓ Defined class-specific abilities for Mage, Fighter, and Ranger
   - ✓ Implemented ability unlock system based on character level

3. **Integration with Fighter Model**
   - ✓ Created integration utilities to bridge progression system with Fighter model
   - ✓ Added mappings between FighterClass and CharacterClass
   - ✓ Implemented conversion between Fighter and Character models
   - ✓ Added abilities and sprite path retrieval for fighters

4. **UI Components**
   - ✓ Implemented FighterProgressionCard component to display fighter with progression details
   - ✓ Created LevelUpModal for allocating stat points after level up
   - ✓ Added LevelUpAnimation for visual effects during level up

5. **Testing**
   - ✓ Added unit tests for character progression system
   - ✓ Added integration tests for fighter-character integration

## Pending Tasks

1. **Direct Game Integration**
   - [ ] Integrate character progression directly into the arena/battle flow
   - [ ] Add XP gain after battles in existing battle results screen
   - [ ] Show level-up animations and stat allocation within the main game UI
   - [ ] Remove all standalone demo pages in favor of integrated functionality

2. **Fighter Integration**
   - [ ] Update existing fighter profiles to show progression data
   - [ ] Integrate abilities with existing battle system
   - [ ] Implement passive abilities that affect combat mechanics
   - [ ] Update character selection screens to show progression status

3. **Backend Integration**
   - [ ] Update existing fighter database models to store progression data
   - [ ] Modify API endpoints to include progression when fetching fighters
   - [ ] Add validation to prevent cheating or manipulation

4. **Reuse Existing Assets**
   - [ ] Map progression visual effects to existing game assets
   - [ ] Ensure level-up animations work with existing fighter sprites
   - [ ] Integrate ability icons with existing UI elements
   - [ ] Standardize visual styles with the rest of the game

5. **Testing & QA**
   - [ ] Write more comprehensive tests for edge cases
   - [ ] Perform integration tests with the actual battle system
   - [ ] Add end-to-end tests for the complete progression flow within battles

6. **Documentation**
   - [ ] Update existing game documentation to include progression system
   - [ ] Create developer guidelines emphasizing integration over new creation
   - [ ] Document integration points for future feature development

## Integration Testing

1. **Test in Actual Game Context:**
   - Test progression within real battles
   - Verify XP gain and level-up in the main game flow
   - Test ability unlocks and their effects in combat
   - Ensure progression data persists correctly in the database

2. **Run Automated Tests:**
   - Use `npm test` to run all unit and integration tests
   - Check combat integration with `npm test -- --testPathPattern=combat`

## Integration Strategy

1. **Modify Existing Battle Flow**
   - Update `simulateFight.ts` to incorporate progression and ability mechanics
   - Modify `BattleArena.ts` to display ability usage and progression elements
   - Extend `FighterProfile.tsx` to show progression data

2. **Update Database Integration**
   - Modify `schema.prisma` to include progression fields
   - Update fighter API endpoints to handle progression data
   - Ensure all fighter queries include progression information

3. **Use Existing UI Framework**
   - Integrate level-up components into the existing UI system
   - Use the game's established color scheme and visual style
   - Follow the existing UI patterns for consistency

4. **Implementation Guidelines**
   - Always check for existing functionality before creating new components
   - Prioritize enhancing current systems over building new parallel ones
   - When in doubt, refactor existing code rather than creating new systems
