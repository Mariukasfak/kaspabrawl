# Fixing KaspaWallet Authentication Issues

üõ†Ô∏è **Updates since last fixes**

## Problem Analysis
Based on the error logs, we identified a critical issue with the wallet authentication:

```
useWalletAuth.ts:293 Request body: {nonce: '14149f6e00...', signature: '...', publicKey: '...', address: undefined}
```

The address was `undefined` in the request body, causing a 400 Bad Request error with "Missing signature" message.

## Fixed Issues

1. **Address Handling in `useWalletAuth.ts`**
   - Fixed incorrect address reference in the verification request
   - Now correctly sending the address from `requestAccounts()` instead of from the signature result

2. **Improved Signature Handling in `kaspaWalletHelper.ts`**
   - Enhanced the `signWithWallet` function to ensure address is always included
   - Added a fallback to use the provided address when the wallet returns undefined

3. **Better Error Diagnostics**
   - Added detailed logging of the request body in the verification endpoint
   - Created a diagnostic endpoint at `/api/debug/kasware-signature-debug`
   - Added a "Analyze Wallet Signature" button to the enhanced wallet test page

4. **Enhanced Error Handling**
   - Improved error reporting with more context about the failed request
   - Added validation of the raw request body to catch parsing issues

## Testing Instructions

1. Visit `/enhanced-wallet-test` and test the connection
2. If the connection fails, use the "Analyze Wallet Signature" button
3. Check the signature analysis for potential issues
4. Ensure your wallet is unlocked before attempting connection

## Remaining Work

- Test with different wallets (KaspaWallet vs Kasware) to verify fixes work for both
- Further improve verification to handle wallet-specific signature formats
- Add more robust error recovery for failed authentication
- Consider implementing a fallback authentication method for local development

## Technical Notes

The main issue was that the address from the signature result was sometimes undefined, while we had a valid address from the initial account request. We now correctly use that address throughout the authentication flow.
